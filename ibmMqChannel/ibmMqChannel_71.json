2. Verify that the client and server are using compatible SSL/TLS versions and cipher suites.
3. If using a self-signed certificate, consider generating a new one or obtaining an official one from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
4. Ensure that the IBM MQ client and server have the same time settings. This is important for proper encryption and decryption of data.
5. If the problem persists, consider restarting the IBM MQ broker and queue manager to reset any potential issues.
6. As a last resort, you may need to contact IBM Support for further assistance.

For more information on resolving this issue, refer to the IBM MQ documentation or contact IBM Support.",
