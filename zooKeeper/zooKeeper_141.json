2. Verify that your data is being replicated across multiple nodes correctly. If there are any issues with replication, it could lead to increased request latencies.
3. Check the network connectivity between the client and ZooKeeper server to ensure there are no network-related issues causing delays.
4. Monitor the load on the ZooKeeper server to ensure it is not overwhelmed by too many concurrent requests.
5. If the problem persists, consider increasing the number of ZooKeeper servers or adding more resources (CPU, memory) to the existing servers to handle the increased load.

By implementing these steps, you should be able to reduce the Maximum request latency in ZooKeeper.",
