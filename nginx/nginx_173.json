You can check this by running the command "openssl s_client -connect example.com:443" in a terminal, where "example.com" is your website's domain name. If the output shows that the certificate is valid, then everything is set up correctly.
2. Check if there are any errors in your Nginx configuration file related to SSL. Open the file "/etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site-name" and look for any lines containing "error" or "invalid." If you find any, correct them immediately.
3. Make sure that the "listen" directive in your Nginx configuration file is set correctly. It should be something like "listen 443 ssl;". Without the "ssl" part, Nginx will not be able to handle SSL connections.
4. If you're still experiencing issues, try restarting Nginx and Apache (if you're using Apache as a reverse proxy) to ensure that any temporary problems have been resolved. You can do this by running the commands "systemctl restart nginx" and "systemctl restart apache2" respectively.
5. If none of these steps work, you may need to contact your web hosting provider for further assistance. They may be able to provide more specific guidance based on your setup.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
