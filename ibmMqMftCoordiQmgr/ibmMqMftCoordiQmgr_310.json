2. Verify the message flow: Make sure that messages are being transferred between the sender and receiver queues correctly.
3. Inspect the error logs: Review any error or exception logs generated during the file transfer process to identify the root cause of the failure.
4. Check for missing or corrupted files: If the file transfer fails with an "Invalid Handle" error, it could be due to missing or corrupted files.
5. Restart the IBM MQ queue manager: In some cases, restarting the queue manager can help resolve the issue.
6. Update the IBM MQ software: Make sure that your IBM MQ software is up-to-date, as outdated versions may have bugs or compatibility issues that could cause file transfer failures.
7. Consult the IBM MQ documentation: If you continue to experience issues, refer to the IBM MQ documentation for further troubleshooting guidance.",
