 3. Ensure that the user running the IBM MFT agent has the necessary permissions to access the queue manager and its associated objects.

 4. Check the IBM MFT agent logs for any error messages or warnings that may provide more information about the cause of the issue.

 5. If the problem persists, consider restarting the IBM MQ MFT agent or the entire IBM MQ infrastructure.
