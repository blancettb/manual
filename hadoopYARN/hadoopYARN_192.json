2. Verify that the application's configuration is correct. Ensure that the application's jar file and other dependencies are present and properly formatted.
3. Check the resource manager logs for any issues with the application. The resource manager logs are usually found in the /var/log/hadoop-yarn/ directory. Look for any error messages or warnings related to the application.
4. If the problem persists, consider increasing the memory allocated to the application. This can be done by modifying the application's resource request in the YARN application submit command.
5. If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact the Hadoop support team for further assistance.

For more information on troubleshooting YARN applications, you can refer to the official Apache Hadoop documentation: <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/index.html>",
