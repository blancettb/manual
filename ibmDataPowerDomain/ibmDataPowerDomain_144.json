2. Verify that the maximum memory allocation for the IBM DataPower Domain is not set too high, which could lead to resource contention and high memory usage. Adjust the maximum memory allocation as necessary.
3. Monitor the IBM DataPower Domain's memory usage over time using tools such as the command line interface (CLI) or the web console. This will help identify trends and potential issues before they become critical.
4. Regularly review and update the system configuration settings for the IBM DataPower Domain, including the number of worker threads and connection limits. These settings can significantly impact memory usage.
5. If the problem persists, consider increasing the amount of physical memory allocated to the IBM DataPower Domain or upgrading to a more powerful hardware platform. However, this should be considered as a last resort due to the associated costs and potential disruptions.",
