 2. Adjust the retention policy: You can adjust the retention policy for backups and logs to reduce the amount of data stored. This will help in lowering the disk usage.
 3. Clean up old backups: Regularly clean up old backups to ensure they do not consume unnecessary disk space. You can use the command `etcdctl set /registry/healthcheck/config retention.max_backups=<number>` to set the maximum number of backups.
 4. Monitor disk usage: Continuously monitor the disk usage to ensure it remains below the configured threshold. You can use the command `etcdctl get /registry/healthcheck/config` to view the current configuration.
 5. Contact support: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider contacting IBM Support for further assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the Percentage of disk space used is too high issue in your IBM Cloud infrastructure.",
