2. Monitor the Jboss Data Grid performance metrics to identify any potential bottlenecks or issues that may be causing caches to not run properly.
3. Adjust the Jboss Data Grid settings, such as the maximum size of caches or the frequency of cache eviction, to optimize the cache performance and reduce the likelihood of caches being stuck in a non-running state.
4. If necessary, consider increasing the heap size of the application server to accommodate more caches and improve overall system performance.
5. Review the application code and ensure that it is designed to handle the expected cache usage patterns, avoiding excessive cache creations or deletions that could lead to cache instability.
6. If the problem persists after attempting these steps, consider contacting the Jboss Data Grid support team for further assistance. They can help you diagnose and address any underlying issues with your specific setup.",
