2. Increase the maximum size of messages that can be stored in the message broker by modifying the `max-size-bytes` property in the `activemq.xml` configuration file. This can help prevent future high storage usage issues caused by large messages.
3. Monitor the storage usage over time to ensure that it returns to normal levels after taking these steps. You may need to take additional actions if the high storage usage persists.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the high storage usage issue in ActiveMQ and avoid potential performance problems caused by limited storage capacity.",
