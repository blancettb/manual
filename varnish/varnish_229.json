This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

2. Analyze the Varnish logs for potential errors or warnings related to high eviction rates. Look for any patterns or spikes in the log data that may indicate the root cause of the issue.
3. Investigate the backend servers' resource utilization. Ensure that the servers have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and network) to handle the current traffic load. High resource utilization may lead to increased evictions due to swapping or other performance issues.
4. Review the application code for potential bottlenecks or issues that could result in excessive object creation or destruction. Optimize the code where necessary to reduce unnecessary object allocations and deallocations.
5. Implement proper caching strategies to minimize the need for frequent object evictions. This may include using cache invalidation techniques, adjusting cache expiration times, or implementing least recently used (LRU) or first-in-first-out (FIFO) caching algorithms.
6. Monitor the system's performance closely after implementing the above steps. If the issue persists, consider increasing the Varnish instance's buffer size or adjusting the eviction threshold to accommodate higher traffic loads. However, be cautious not to set these parameters too high as they may negatively impact the overall system performance.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and address the underlying causes of the Sudden increase in evicted objects issue, thereby improving the overall system performance and stability.",
