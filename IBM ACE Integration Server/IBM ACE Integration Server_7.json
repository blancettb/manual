 2. If the integration server is not running, start it by running the command 'ace_server start'.

 3. If the integration server is already running and the switchover state is stuck at 'Initializing', you can force a switchover by stopping the integration server on the primary node and starting it on the secondary node using the commands 'ace_server stop' and 'ace_server start'.

 4. After the switchover is complete, you can verify that the integration server is functioning properly by sending a test message through it.

If the problem persists after trying these steps, you may need to contact IBM support for further assistance.",
