2. Identify any partitions that are in the "Offline" state. These partitions are causing the producer and consumer to be blocked.
3. To bring these partitions back online, you can use the command `kafka-topics.sh --alter --topic <topic> --partitions <partition_number> --replication-factor <new_replication_factor> --force`. Replace <topic> with the name of your topic and <partition\_number> with the number of the partition you want to bring back online. Also, replace <new\_replication\_factor> with the desired replication factor for the partition.
4. After bringing the partitions back online, restart the producer and consumer services to ensure that they are using the updated configuration.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of Producers and consumer being blocked due to partitions being offline in your Kafka cluster.",
