1. Increase the maximum number of active sessions for your application. You can do this by modifying the `maxActive` parameter in your application's configuration file or through environment variables. The default value for this parameter is typically low, so increasing it may help accommodate more concurrent users.
2. Implement connection pooling to manage and reuse connections efficiently. Connection pooling can help prevent excessive resource usage and improve overall application performance.
3. Monitor your application's resource usage, such as CPU, memory, and network I/O. If you notice any consistently high resource utilization, consider optimizing your application code, reducing data transfer sizes, or scaling down your application temporarily to avoid reaching the maximum number of active sessions.
4. Check if there are any issues with your authentication or authorization mechanisms. Incorrectly configured authentication or authorization rules can lead to an increased number of active sessions. Ensure that your security configurations are up-to-date and correctly implemented.
5. Investigate any potential concurrency issues caused by asynchronous tasks or long-running processes within your application. If these tasks are not properly managed, they could contribute to the excessive number of active sessions. Implement proper synchronization or buffering techniques to mitigate these issues.
6. Review your application logs for any error messages or warnings related to session management or connection pooling. These messages can provide valuable insights into the root cause of the problem and suggest appropriate solutions.
7. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider upgrading to a more powerful hardware or cloud infrastructure to support a higher number of active sessions. However, this should be considered as a last resort since it involves significant costs and potential disruptions to your application's service availability.",
