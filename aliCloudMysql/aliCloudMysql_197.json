 2. Adjust the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` parameter in your MySQL configuration file to allocate more memory for caching data. This can help reduce the frequency of disk I/O and improve overall performance.
 3. Monitor your system's memory usage over time and adjust the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` parameter accordingly based on your observations.
 4. If the issue persists, consider increasing the size of your MySQL instance or adding more resources (such as CPU or RAM) to your hosting environment.
 5. You may also want to review your database schema and query patterns to ensure they are optimized for memory usage efficiency.
