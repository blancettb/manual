2. Next, review the proposal ratios to ensure that they are within normal ranges. If the proposal ratio is significantly higher than expected, it could suggest issues with proposal quality or the effectiveness of the proposal evaluation process.
3. Investigate any discrepancies between the proposal ratios and the number of proposals received. This could indicate issues with data collection or reporting.
4. Take corrective action as necessary to address any issues identified in the proposal ratio analysis. This may include adjusting the proposal approval process, improving proposal quality, or providing additional training for proposal evaluators.
5. Regularly monitor the proposal ratio analysis to ensure that it remains within normal ranges. This will help identify any trends or patterns that may require further investigation and correction.",
