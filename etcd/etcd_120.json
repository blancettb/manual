 2. Next, check if there are any corrupted data directories in your etcd cluster. You can do this by running the command `etcdctl ls /var/lib/etcd/wal/` and verifying that all the files have a size of 0. If any file has a non-zero size, you should repair the corrupted directory using the command `etcdctl repair <directory_path>`.

 3. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may want to consider increasing the number of wal files for your etcd cluster. To do this, run the command `etcdctl set wal.dir /var/lib/etcd/wal/wal<n>` where <n> represents the desired number of wal files.

 4. Lastly, restart the etcd service to apply the changes.
