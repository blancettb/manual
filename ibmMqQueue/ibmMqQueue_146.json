2. If the current queue depth is close to or greater than the maximum queue depth, it indicates that the queue is close to being full.
3. To free up space in the queue, you can either reduce the number of messages in the queue or increase the maximum queue depth.
4. Reducing the number of messages in the queue can be done by processing or deleting messages as needed.
5. Increasing the maximum queue depth can be done by modifying the queue definition in the IBM MQ configuration file.
6. After making these changes, restart the IBM MQ queue manager to apply the new settings.

It's important to note that increasing the maximum queue depth should be done with caution, as it can potentially lead to performance issues if not managed properly.",
