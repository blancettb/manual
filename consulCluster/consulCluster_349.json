 2. Verify that the Consul agent is running on all nodes in the cluster and that it is configured correctly.
 3. Check the network connectivity between nodes in the cluster to ensure that there are no issues with communication.
 4. If the problem persists, you may need to restart the Consul agent on the unhealthy node or remove and re-add it to the cluster.

If you are still experiencing issues, you may want to consider checking the Consul documentation or reaching out to the Consul support team for further assistance.",
