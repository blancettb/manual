2. Optimize your PHP scripts by minimizing their complexity, reducing database queries, and using caching mechanisms.
3. Implement connection pooling in your application to limit the number of open connections and reduce resource usage.
4. Monitor your server's logs for any patterns or spikes in connection resets, which could indicate an underlying issue.
5. If the problem persists, consider increasing the timeout value in your php.ini file to give the FPM more time to handle requests before closing connections. However, this should be used as a last resort since it can potentially lead to other issues.

Additionally, if you are running Nginx in front of php-fpm, you can increase the client_max_body_size and max_execution_time settings in your nginx.conf file to improve performance and stability.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to investigate further by checking for any errors in your application code, reviewing system logs, or seeking assistance from a professional server administrator.",
