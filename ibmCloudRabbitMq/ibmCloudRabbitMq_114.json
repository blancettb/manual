2. If there are no specific error messages, try increasing the rabbitmq\_user\_memory and rabbitmq\_admin\_memory settings in the RabbitMQ configuration file (usually located at /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config) to allow for more memory usage. However, keep in mind that increasing these values may also increase the risk of running out of memory if not managed properly.
3. Monitor the RabbitMQ server's memory usage over time using tools like top or htop to identify any sudden spikes in memory consumption.
4. If the memory usage continues to be an issue, consider upgrading your system's hardware resources (CPU, RAM) to accommodate the increased memory requirements of the RabbitMQ server.
5. Implement proper resource management practices, such as regularly stopping and starting the RabbitMQ server when it is not in use, and monitoring its resource usage to prevent excessive memory consumption.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the Memory usage too high issue on your IBM Cloud RabbitMQ server.",
