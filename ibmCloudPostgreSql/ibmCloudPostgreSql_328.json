1. Check the current CPU usage and identify if it is indeed high. You can use the command `top` or `htop` on Linux systems or the Task Manager on Windows systems to view the CPU usage.
2. If the CPU usage is high, consider increasing the maximum number of connections for your PostgreSQL database. This can be done by modifying the max_connections parameter in your PostgreSQL configuration file. However, keep in mind that increasing this value may also impact the overall system performance.
3. Monitor the system's load average over time. A high load average could indicate that the system is struggling to handle the current workload, leading to high CPU usage.
4. Investigate any queries or processes that are consuming a significant amount of CPU resources. You can use the `pg_stat_activity` view in PostgreSQL to view information about currently active queries and their resource consumption.
5. Consider optimizing slow-performing queries or processes. Analyzing these queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE can help you identify potential issues and suggest optimization techniques.
6. Review your PostgreSQL configuration settings. Ensure that the settings are optimized for your specific use case. For example, you may want to adjust the query_cache_size, work_mem, and maintenance\_work_mem parameters to improve query performance and reduce CPU usage.
7. If the issue persists, consider scaling out your PostgreSQL deployment by adding more nodes to distribute the workload. This can help improve performance and reduce CPU usage.
8. Lastly, ensure that your operating system and other system components are up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Outdated software can sometimes cause unexpected issues, including high CPU usage.",
