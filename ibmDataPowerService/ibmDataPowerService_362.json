2. If there are no apparent issues with running jobs or processes, consider increasing the memory allocation for the IBM DataPower Service. This can typically be done by modifying the configuration file for the service. The exact steps for doing this will depend on the specific version and configuration of your IBM DataPower Service.
3. Another potential solution is to adjust the settings for the IBM DataPower Service's garbage collection mechanism. Garbage collection is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by the service. By adjusting the garbage collection settings, you may be able to reduce the overall memory usage of the service.
4. Finally, it's also worth checking the logs for the IBM DataPower Service to see if there are any error messages or warnings related to memory usage. These messages can provide valuable information for troubleshooting the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact IBM Support for further assistance.",
