2. Check the events associated with the identified pod by running the command `kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>` and looking for any events related to the condition.
3. If an event is found, investigate the cause of the issue and address it accordingly. This could involve restarting the pod, updating its configuration, or addressing resource exhaustion issues.
4. If no events are found, consider increasing the time threshold for the pod's condition status before triggering an alert or taking further action. The default value is 5 minutes, which can be adjusted using the `--min-container-status-age=<duration>` flag in the `kubectl` command.
5. Once the issue has been resolved, you can manually update the pod's condition status back to True by running the command `kubectl set image <pod_name> --image=<new_image_name> --force-update-containers` if the problem was due to an outdated container image.
6. To ensure that the issue does not recur, implement appropriate monitoring and maintenance strategies for the affected system components.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most Kubernetes pod condition status issues.",
