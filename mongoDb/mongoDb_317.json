1. Increase the amount of physical memory available for the system by adding more RAM. This will directly help in reducing the non-mapped virtual memory ratio.
2. Adjust the MongoDB buffer size settings. Increasing the buffer size can help reduce the frequency of virtual memory swaps, thereby decreasing the non-mapped virtual memory ratio. However, it's important to note that increasing the buffer size may also increase the overall memory usage.
3. Monitor the MongoDB system's performance and adjust the settings accordingly. Keep an eye on the non-mapped virtual memory ratio and make adjustments as needed.
4. Check for any rogue or misbehaving applications that might be consuming excessive amounts of memory. If found, take necessary actions to rectify the issues.
5. Regularly review and optimize your MongoDB database schema and queries. Efficient data modeling and querying can significantly improve the system's performance and reduce the non-mapped virtual memory ratio.
6. Implement proper caching strategies. Caching frequently used data can help reduce the number of disk I/O operations, which in turn can decrease the non-mapped virtual memory ratio.
7. Consider using a larger journal size for MongoDB. A larger journal size can help reduce the frequency of checkpointing, which can decrease the non-mapped virtual memory ratio.
8. Update your MongoDB software to the latest version. MongoDB releases regular updates that include performance improvements and bug fixes, which could potentially address the Too high ratio of non-mapped virtual memory issue.
9. Consult MongoDB support or consult their official documentation for further assistance. They might provide specific guidance based on your particular setup and circumstances.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively manage and reduce the Too high ratio of non-mapped virtual memory issue in MongoDB.",
