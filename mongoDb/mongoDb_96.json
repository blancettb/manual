2. Optimize Data Structures: Ensure that your data structures are optimized for read/write operations. This may involve re-designing your database schema, using indexes, or implementing partitioning strategies.

3. Adjust Max Lock Timeout: If the issue persists, you can adjust the maxLockTimeout setting in the MongoDB configuration file. A higher value can help prevent excessive write locking. However, keep in mind that this may impact overall system performance.

4. Monitor Journal Size: Keep an eye on the size of the journal. If it becomes excessively large, it could lead to write lock issues. You can implement a strategy to automatically archive old journals or set up alerts when the journal size reaches a certain threshold.

5. Implement MongoDB Tuning: Regularly review and optimize MongoDB's performance settings based on your specific workload and hardware requirements. This includes adjusting buffer sizes, thread pool settings, and other relevant parameters.

6. Consider Sharding: If your MongoDB instance has a large dataset and multiple users, sharding might be a viable solution to distribute the load and reduce write lock contention.

7. Update MongoDB Version: Make sure your MongoDB instance is up-to-date. Newer versions often include performance improvements and bug fixes related to write locks.

8. Consult MongoDB Support: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider reaching out to MongoDB support for further assistance. They can provide more specialized guidance based on your specific situation and environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to address the Journal commits in write lock growing issue in MongoDB.",
