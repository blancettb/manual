2. Adjust Flush Stage Max Wait Time: By default, MongoDB uses a short flush stage max wait time (10 seconds). Increasing this value can help reduce background flushing. However, it's essential to set an appropriate value based on your specific workload and system resources.
3. Optimize Database Configuration: Ensure that your MongoDB database configuration is optimized for performance. This includes tuning the buffer size, journal size, and other relevant settings. You",
