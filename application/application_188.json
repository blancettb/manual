  "description": "Detects a rapid drop in the values of the calls KPI metric relative to the values in the last 30 minutes. The magnitude of the drop in calls should also exceed the relative and absolute threshold parameters below. This rule only applies for Applications configured to use All Calls KPIs or that have not yet been configured to use by, default, either All Calls or Inbound Calls KPIs.
This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

2. Check if there are any known issues or maintenance activities related to the telephony infrastructure or applications that could be impacting the call volume.
3. Investigate if there are any configuration changes made to the KPIs or any associated filters that might be causing the unexpected behavior.
4. Ensure that the relative and absolute threshold parameters are set correctly according to your requirements.
5. If the issue persists, consider increasing the time window for the EDM algorithm to analyze, which can help detect more subtle changes in the call volume trend.
6. Consult the documentation or contact support for further assistance if needed.

For more information about this rule and its parameters, refer to the official documentation or contact support.",
