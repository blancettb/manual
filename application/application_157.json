The detector is however not strict and tolerates certain amount of decreases in the metric value inside the trend candidate. This rule only applies for Applications configured to use Inbound Calls KPIs or that have not yet been configured to use by, default, either All Calls or Inbound Calls KPIs.",

1. Analyze the data and identify any patterns or anomalies in the inbound call rate data. Look for any periods of rapid increase or decrease in the data.
2. Check if there are any known issues or changes in the system or application that could be causing the increased error rate.
3. Adjust the rule parameters to reduce the sensitivity or false positive rate. You can do this by changing the threshold values or the time window used for the analysis.
4. Implement corrective actions based on the findings from your analysis. This could include fixing bugs, optimizing the system, or adjusting staffing levels as needed.
5. Monitor the inbound call rate data and the error rate over time to ensure that the issue has been resolved and that the new rules are effectively detecting trends.

By following these steps, you can help ensure that your application is accurately detecting and responding to trends in the inbound call rate data.",
