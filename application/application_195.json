  "description": "This rule checks a presence of an increasing trend in a given metric. The rule is tuned to detect weakly monotonous increases in the given metric. The detector is however not strict and tolerates certain amount of decreases in the metric value inside the trend candidate. This rule only applies for Applications configured to use All Calls KPIs or that have not yet been configured to use by, default, either All Calls or Inbound Calls KPIs.",

1. Check if there are any filters applied on the KPI that might be causing the decreasing values. If so, consider removing them to see if it resolves the issue.
2. Ensure that the time period selected for the KPI is appropriate. If necessary, adjust the time period to capture the entire trend.
3. Verify if the Detector Threshold is set appropriately. You may need to increase the threshold to allow for some decreases in the metric value within the trend candidate.
4. Consider adding a filter to exclude spikes in the data from the analysis. This can help to prevent false positives caused by temporary fluctuations in the metric value.
5. If the problem persists, you may want to review the data source settings to ensure that the data is being collected and processed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and address the root cause of the Increasing trend in erroneous call rate issue.",
