  "description": "Detects a rapid drop to zero (essentially the service is not being called anymore) in the values of the calls KPI metric relative to the values in the last 30 minutes. The magnitude of the drop in calls should also exceed the relative and absolute threshold parameters below. This rule only applies for Applications configured to use Inbound Calls KPIs or that have not yet been configured to use by, default, either All Calls or Inbound Calls KPIs.
This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

 2. Review the Distribution Over Time chart.
 3. Look for any unusual spikes or drops in the data.
 4. If an anomaly is found, investigate the cause of the spike or drop.
 5. Once the issue has been identified and resolved, monitor the KPI for a period of time to ensure that the issue has been fully resolved.

If you are unable to identify the root cause of the issue, you may need to contact support for further assistance.

Additionally, it's important to note that this rule is designed to detect significant changes in the call volume, and it may not catch all cases where there is a temporary decrease in call volume. It's always a good practice to monitor KPIs and metrics regularly to ensure that they are providing accurate and up-to-date information.",
