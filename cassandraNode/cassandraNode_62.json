2. Investigate the cause of the pending compactions, such as increased data churn, network issues, or resource constraints.
3. Take appropriate action based on the root cause:
   - If it's due to increased data churn, consider implementing data archival strategies or optimizing write operations to reduce the rate of data changes.
   - If it's due to network issues, ensure that your network infrastructure is properly configured and optimized for Cassandra.
   - If it's due to resource constraints, monitor and optimize resource usage on the affected nodes.
4. Monitor the Cassandra cluster closely after taking corrective actions to ensure that the pending compactions do not recur.

By addressing the underlying causes of pending compactions, you can improve the overall performance and stability of your Cassandra cluster.",
