This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

2. Investigate any spikes or anomalies in the data that may have caused the sudden drop.
3. Check the Cassandra nodes for any issues, such as high disk usage, network latency, or node failures.
4. If necessary, adjust the retention policy for the metric to ensure that it captures sufficient data for analysis.
5. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar issues in the future.

By following these steps, you can effectively diagnose and address the Sudden drop in write requests issue in your Cassandra environment.",
