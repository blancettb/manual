Check the status of the primary and secondary ACE Integration Servers using the command "netstat -an | grep 6001" on the machine hosting the primary server and "netstat -an | grep 6002" on the machine hosting the secondary server. The expected output should be similar to "LISTEN" for both ports.
2. If the primary server is active (LISTENING), stop it using the command "sudo systemctl stop ace-integration-server".
3. Start the secondary server by executing "sudo systemctl start ace-integration-server".
4. Verify that the secondary server is now active by checking its status with the netstat command mentioned in step 1.
5. To confirm that the data has been successfully switched over, check the /var/log/ace-integration-server/switchover.log file on the primary server for any error messages or indications of successful switchover.
6. If there are any errors in the log file, investigate and address them accordingly.
7. Once the switchover is complete, restart the primary server if necessary.
8. Lastly, ensure that all dependent services are started and running properly.

By following these steps, you can effectively resolve the ACE Integration Server switchover state issue.",
