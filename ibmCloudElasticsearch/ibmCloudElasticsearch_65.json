1. Check the current CPU usage and identify if it is indeed high. You can use the command `top` or `htop` in Linux or macOS systems to view the real-time CPU usage. If the CPU usage is consistently high (above 80% for example), proceed to the next step.
2. Analyze the Elasticsearch logs to identify any potential issues causing the high CPU usage. You can use tools like Kibana's Log Analysis feature or Elasticsearch's built-in log analysis capabilities to filter and analyze the logs. Look for any patterns, spikes, or anomalies in the logs that might indicate the root cause of the high CPU usage.
3. Investigate the JVM settings and ensure they are optimized for your specific workload. Adjusting the garbage collection parameters, heap size, or other JVM settings can help reduce CPU usage. YouUTC",
