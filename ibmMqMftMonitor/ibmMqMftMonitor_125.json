2. Verify that the IBM MQ MFT monitor user has the necessary permissions to run the service. You can do this by running the command `ps -ef | grep mqmftd`. The user should be listed with a process ID (PID) and a terminal symbol (>).
3. If the user does not have the necessary permissions, you can add them by running the command `sudo usermod -aG mqmft <user_name>`, replacing <user_name> with the actual user name.
4. Restart the IBM MQ MFT monitor service for the changes to take effect by typing `sudo systemctl restart mqmftd`.

If the problem persists after trying these steps, you may need to check the IBM MQ MFT monitor logs for more information. These logs are typically located in the /var/mqmft/logs directory.",
