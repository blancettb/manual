This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

 2. Once the root cause is identified, take appropriate action to address it. This may involve resolving network congestion, upgrading servers, patching application bugs, or implementing other corrective measures.
 3. After taking corrective actions, monitor the latency KPI closely to ensure that it returns to normal levels.
 4. If the latency continues to remain high even after addressing the root cause, consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to future occurrences more quickly.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and mitigate the impact of sudden increases in latency, ensuring smooth and reliable operation of your services.",
