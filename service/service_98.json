  "description": "Detects a rapid increase in the values of the erroneous call rate metric relative to the values in the last 10 minutes. The magnitude of the increase in erroneous call rate should also exceed the relative and absolute threshold parameters below.
This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

2. Once the root cause has been identified, take appropriate action to address it. This may involve fixing bugs, improving network performance, or implementing new processes to prevent similar errors from occurring.
3. After addressing the root cause, monitor the erroneous call rate metric closely to ensure that it returns to normal levels. If the erroneous call rate continues to rise after taking corrective actions, further investigation and intervention may be necessary.

It's important to note that this rule is designed to detect significant increases in erroneous call rates, but it does not provide specific information about the underlying causes of the increase. Identifying the root cause of the issue is crucial for resolving the problem effectively.",
