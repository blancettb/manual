   2. Verify if the required table or database exists in the CDH cluster by running the command `psql` and connecting to the CDH cluster's postgres instance. Then, run the query `\dt` to list all tables in the current schema.
   3. If the required table does not exist, create it using the following SQL command:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE <table\_name> (
        <column\_name> <data\_type>
        ...
      );
      ```
   4. After creating the table, restart the Hive service on the CDH cluster to apply the changes.
   5. Once the Hive service is restarted, check if the missing metrics are now available in the CDP environment.",
