 2. **Examine your code for potential issues**: Look for any error handling mechanisms that might be causing repeated requests. Also, ensure your code is not performing unnecessary queries or mutations.
 3. **Optimize your queries and mutations**: Use the least amount of queries and mutations necessary to fulfill your application's requirements. This can help reduce the overall request count.
 4. **Monitor query performance**: Monitor the execution time and resource utilization of your queries. Long-running or resource-intensive queries can contribute to an increased request count.
 5. **Resize your instance or app engine project**: If the issue persists even after optimizing, consider resizing your instance or app engine project based on your traffic patterns and resource availability.
 6. **Contact Google Cloud Support**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact Google Cloud Support for further assistance. They can provide more specific guidance based on your situation and environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and address the cause of the increased GCP Datastore request count.",
