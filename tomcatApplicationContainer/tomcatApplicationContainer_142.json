2. If you find any suspicious activity, investigate the root cause, such as code changes, configuration issues, or third-party integrations.
3. Once you have identified the cause, take appropriate action to address it, such as rolling back code changes, fixing configuration errors, or disabling problematic third-party integrations.
4. After addressing the issue, monitor your application logs and server metrics to ensure that the number of sessions returns to normal levels.

If you are still experiencing problems, you may want to consider increasing the threshold value for this rule or adjusting the time window to better match your specific use case. You",
