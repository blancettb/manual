2. Verify that the application is running smoothly and there are no exceptions or crashes.
3. If the application is running fine, check if there are any scheduled maintenance activities or updates that could have caused a temporary decrease in the number of sessions.
4. Investigate if there are any changes in the user behavior or application usage pattern that might be responsible for the sudden drop in session count.
5. If none of the above steps provide an answer, consider increasing the monitoring frequency for this rule to get more detailed insights into the situation.

Additionally, you can also refer to the provided documentation for more information about the rule and its configuration options.
