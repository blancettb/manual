2. If there are no apparent issues, increase the desired replicas value in the DaemonSet configuration file. You can do this by modifying the YAML file and updating the desiredReplicas field. Save the changes and apply them using `kubectl apply -f <daemonset-file>.yaml`.
3. After making the change, allow some time for the new replicas to be created. It might take a few minutes for the DaemonSet to scale up the number of replicas based on the updated configuration.
4. Verify that the problem has been resolved by checking the DaemonSet's status again. The Available replicas should now be greater than or equal to the desired replicas.
5. If the issue persists, consider investigating other potential causes, such as resource exhaustion or network connectivity problems.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the Available replicas is less than desired replicas issue in your Kubernetes DaemonSet.",
