2. Monitor the MongoDB instance's performance metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk I/O, to identify any potential bottlenecks or spikes in resource consumption.
3. If necessary, adjust the MongoDB instance's configuration settings, such as the maximum heap size, buffer pool size, or connection pool size, to optimize its performance and reduce memory usage.
4. Regularly review and analyze the MongoDB instance's logs to detect any anomalies or errors that may be contributing to high memory usage.
5. Implement proper data indexing strategies to improve query performance and reduce the amount of data stored in memory.
6. Consider using third-party tools or plugins for monitoring and optimizing MongoDB instances, such as MongoDB Atlas, Cerebro, or MongoDB Compass.
7. If the issue persists, consider scaling out the MongoDB cluster by adding more nodes to distribute the workload and increase overall capacity.
8. Keep your MongoDB software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates to ensure that it is running on the most stable and efficient version available.",
