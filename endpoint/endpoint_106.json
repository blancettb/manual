This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

2. Validate the data quality and completeness of the calls data.
3. Investigate any potential issues with the underlying infrastructure or services that may be impacting the call data generation.
4. If the issue persists, consider adjusting the relative and absolute threshold parameters of the rule to better match the specific situation and avoid false positives or negatives.
5. Monitor the metric over time to ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that the system is stable again.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it may be necessary to contact support for further assistance.",
