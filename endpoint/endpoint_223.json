This rule is powered by a generic sudden drop/increase detector which is based on a modified version of the E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) algorithm for detection of changes in distribution of values of a given metric over the time.",

 2. Investigate the root cause of the issue, such as network problems, application issues, or hardware failures.
 3. Once the root cause is identified, take appropriate action to address it and prevent future occurrences.
 4. If the issue persists, consider adjusting the threshold parameters in the rule to better match your environment's conditions.
