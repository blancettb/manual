 2. Monitor the erroneous call rate metric closely to identify any sudden spikes or trends that may indicate underlying problems.
 3. Investigate potential causes for the high error rate, such as network connectivity issues, software bugs, or configuration errors.
 4. Implement necessary corrective actions to address the root cause(s) and bring the erroneous call rate back down to an acceptable level.
 5. Adjust the threshold value for the erroneous call rate based on your specific use case and requirements, ensuring it remains sensitive enough to detect genuine issues while avoiding false positives.
 6. Continuously evaluate and optimize your monitoring and alerting mechanisms to ensure they remain effective in detecting and addressing synthetic endpoint performance issues.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and maintain the health and performance of your synthetic endpoints, minimizing the risk of erroneous calls and ensuring a positive user experience.",
