1. Check the current usage of your container registry by running the command `ibmcloud cr space`. This will display the total amount of storage used and the available space.
2. If the available space is low, consider deleting old images or containers that are no longer in use. You can use the command `ibmcloud cr image-prune` to remove unused images. Be sure to filter the images by tag or name to avoid accidentally removing necessary images.
3. If the available space remains low after deleting unused images, you may need to increase the storage quota for your container registry. To do this, contact IBM Cloud Support and request an adjustment to your storage limit.
4. Another potential solution is to optimize the size of your images by using tools like ImageOptimizer or Brotli compression before pushing them to the registry. Smaller images will use less storage space.
5. Lastly, regularly monitor your container registry's usage and take proactive measures to prevent storage from reaching its maximum capacity. By staying on top of your storage usage, you can avoid running into issues with exceeding quotas.",
