2. If the current connection limit is too low, increase it by running the command "setmqaut -m QUEUE_MANAGER_NAME -n MAX_CONNECTIONS". Replace "QUEUE_MANAGER_NAME" with the name of your queue manager and "MAX_CONNECTIONS" with the desired new maximum number of connections.
3. Restart the queue manager for the changes to take effect by running the command "stopmqm QUEUE_MANAGER_NAME" and then "startmqm QUEUE_MANAGER_NAME".
4. Monitor the queue manager's connection usage over time to ensure that it does not exceed the new maximum limit.

These steps will help you manage the number of connections to your IBM MQ Queue Manager and prevent any potential issues caused by an excessive number of concurrent connections.",
