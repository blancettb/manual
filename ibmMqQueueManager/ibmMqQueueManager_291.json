2. Verify the bridge: Use the command "netstat -an | grep <bridge_name>" to verify that the bridge is up and running. Replace <bridge_name> with the actual name of your bridge.
3. Review the error logs: Look for any error messages or warnings in the IBM MQ error logs related to the bridge. These logs are typically located in the "<install_dir>/errors" directory.
4. Investigate network connectivity issues: Ensure that there are no network connectivity problems between the components involved in the bridge.
5. Restart the bridge: If all else fails, you can restart the bridge using the command "strmqbr <bridge\_name>".

If you continue to experience issues, consider checking the IBM MQ documentation or reaching out to IBM Support for further assistance.",
