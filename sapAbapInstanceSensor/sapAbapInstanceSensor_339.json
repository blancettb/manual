2. If no errors are found, check the IDOC structure itself for any issues. You can use the SAP ERP's Message Browser (transaction se38) to display the structure of the IDOC.
3. If you find any issues with the IDOC structure, correct them using the appropriate tools provided by your SAP ERP system.
4. Once the IDOC structure is corrected, restart the data transfer process.

If the problem persists after following these steps, it might be a good idea to contact your SAP ERP or ABAP support team for further assistance. They will be able to help you diagnose and resolve any underlying issues more efficiently.",
