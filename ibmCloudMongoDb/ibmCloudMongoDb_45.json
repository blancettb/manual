2. If the disk usage is close to or over the threshold, consider increasing the size of the data files or the log files. To do this, you can modify the `mongod.conf` file by adding or updating the `dbPath` and/or `logPath` settings. The new values should be larger than the current ones.
3. After modifying the configuration file, restart the MongoDB service using the command `sudo systemctl restart mongod`.
4. Monitor the disk usage again after some time to ensure that it remains below the threshold.

If the issue persists, you may need to adjust the threshold value in the monitoring alert or contact the support team for further assistance.",
