2. Check the logs of the mongod process on both the primary and secondary nodes for any error messages or warnings related to network connectivity or other replication-related issues.
3. Ensure that the configuration settings for the Replica Set are correct. Specifically, check that the `bind_ip` parameter in the `mongod.conf` file is set to 0.0.0.0, allowing connections from any IP address.
4. If the problem persists, consider increasing the `networkTimeoutMS` parameter in the `mongod.conf` file to allow for more timeouts during communication between nodes. The default value is 100 ms, which may not be sufficient for high latency networks.
5. Lastly, if none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to restart the mongod process on one or more of the nodes in the Replica Set.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most ReplicaSet monitoring issues.",
