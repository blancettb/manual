 2. Optimize object creation and allocation strategies to minimize memory waste.
 3. Review your application's code for potential memory leaks or unmanaged resource usage.
 4. Increase the maximum allowed percentage value for Garbage Collection time in the rule settings. However, this should be done with caution as setting it too high may negatively impact performance.
 5. Monitor the system's performance after implementing these changes to ensure that the Garbage Collection time remains within the desired range.

By addressing the root causes of high Garbage Collection activity, you can help ensure optimal performance and stability for your application.",
