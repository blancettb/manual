 2. If necessary, adjust the number of executor containers in the Spark configuration to accommodate the available resources and ensure that the application can run successfully.
 3. Verify that the dependencies and required libraries are properly installed and up-to-date on the cluster nodes.
 4. Ensure that the user submitting the application has the appropriate permissions and access to the necessary resources.
 5. If the issue persists, consider increasing the maximum number of applications allowed by the resource manager, which can be done by modifying the spark.yarn.maxApps config property. However, this should be done with caution as it may impact the overall system's performance and stability.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be a good idea to consult the relevant documentation or contact the support team for further assistance.",
