2. If the disk usage is above the limit, consider increasing the disk space allocated to RabbitMQ. You can do this by modifying the `rabbitmq.config` file located in the `/etc/rabbitmq/` directory. To increase the disk space, add or modify the `DiskSpace` setting in the configuration file. The value should be set higher than the current disk usage. For example, if the current disk usage is 100 MB, you can set the `DiskSpace` value to 200 MB.
3. After making the necessary changes to the configuration file, restart RabbitMQ for the changes to take effect. Run the command `rabbitmq-server restart` to restart RabbitMQ.
4. Monitor the RabbitMQ Free Disk space to ensure it remains above the limit. You can use the same command as before (`rabbitmqctl rabbitmqd_disk_usage`) to keep track of the disk usage.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the RabbitMQ Free Disk space is below the limit issue.",
