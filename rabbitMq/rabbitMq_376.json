2. Verify that the RabbitMQ user and password are correct and up-to-date.
3. Ensure that the RabbitMQ user has the necessary permissions to access the required queues and exchange.
4. If the problem persists, consider increasing the maximum number of connections allowed on the RabbitMQ server by modifying the `max_connections` setting in the RabbitMQ configuration file. However, be cautious not to exceed the recommended limit for your specific setup.
5. Restart the RabbitMQ server to apply the changes.
6. Monitor the RabbitMQ server closely after restarting it to ensure that the new connection limit is being respected and that there are no further issues with connection availability.

If you're still experiencing problems, you may want to consult the RabbitMQ documentation or seek assistance from the RabbitMQ community forums for more advanced troubleshooting techniques.",
