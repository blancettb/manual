 2. Review system logs: Look for any error messages or warnings related to TCP in the system logs. These logs can provide more information about the cause of the problem.
 3. Update network drivers: Make sure that the network drivers on the host are up-to-date. Outdated drivers can sometimes cause connection issues and other network problems.
 4. Adjust firewall settings: If the host has a firewall, check its settings to ensure that it is not blocking or limiting traffic from the affected application or service.
 5. Restart the affected service: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider restarting the affected service on the host to see if this resolves the high TCP error rate.
 6. Monitor network performance: Keep an eye on network performance metrics such as latency, packet loss, and throughput to identify any trends or patterns that may indicate a deeper issue.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and address the root cause of the Frequent TCP errors on your host.",
