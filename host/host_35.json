 2. Review system resources: Verify that the host has sufficient memory, CPU, and network resources to handle the workload.
 3. Investigate application behavior: Analyze the application's behavior and ensure that it is not causing unnecessary retransmissions. This may involve tuning application parameters or adjusting its interaction with the network.
 4. Implement appropriate network optimization techniques: Based on your findings, implement network optimization techniques such as traffic shaping, quality of service (QoS), or congestion control algorithms to improve network performance and reduce retransmissions.
 5. Monitor network health: Regularly monitor network health and performance metrics to identify potential issues before they become critical. This will help in maintaining optimal network conditions and reducing the likelihood of retransmissions.
 6. Consult documentation and support resources: Refer to the relevant documentation and support resources for your specific networking hardware and software to ensure that you are following best practices and using the most up-to-date configurations.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively address Permanent TCP retransmissions and improve overall network performance.",
