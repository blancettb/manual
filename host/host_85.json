1. Check for and remove unnecessary background applications or processes that may be consuming excessive memory resources. This can be done by using Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on macOS.
2. Close any resource-intensive applications or browser tabs that are running in the background.
3. Restart your computer if necessary to free up memory resources.
4. If the issue persists, consider increasing the amount of available system memory by adding more RAM modules to your computer. However, this should be done with caution as adding too much memory might cause compatibility issues with your existing hardware.
5. You can also try restarting your computer in Safe Mode to see if the issue is related to a particular software application.
6. If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be a good idea to consult with a professional technical support specialist for further assistance. They can help diagnose and address any potential hardware or software issues causing the memory exhaustion problem.",
