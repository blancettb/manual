The detector is not firing when the remaining disk space is more than 1GB or 1% of the total capacity. However, it will fire if either the remaining disk space is empty (<1MB), or the disk space would fill up within the next 15 minutes based on the current trend.",

   b. If the issue persists, consider increasing the disk space by adding an external drive or upgrading the existing one.

By following these steps, you can help ensure your device has sufficient capacity to operate smoothly and prevent potential data loss or corruption.",
