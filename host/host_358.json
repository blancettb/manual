 2. Adjust the priorities of these applications or services to ensure they do not consume excessive CPU resources.
 3. Check for any misconfigured settings or conflicting software that might be causing the CPU steal time to increase.
 4. If the issue persists, consider upgrading your hardware or adding more physical cores to your system to improve overall performance and reduce CPU steal time.

For further assistance, you can refer to the official documentation or contact the support team of the specific operating system or hardware you are using. They can provide more tailored guidance based on your environment and configuration.",
