  "description": "Detects short-term capacity problems of a disk and fires when the disk is likely to run out of capacity within the next hour. The detector is not firing when the disk freed up a considerable amount of space (>=100MB) in the recent past, or when the remaining disk space is more than 20% of the total capacity. However, it will fire when the disk space would fill up within the next hour based on the current trend. This trend is computed based on a linear regression model fitted on the data points of the current sliding window.",

 2. Consider deleting unnecessary files or moving them to an external storage device to free up disk space.
 3. If the issue persists, you may want to adjust the system's swap space settings. Increasing the swap space can help alleviate memory pressure and prevent out-of-memory errors.
 4. Monitor your disk usage over time to identify any patterns or trends that might be contributing to the issue.
 5. If the issue continues despite your efforts, consider contacting your system administrator or seeking additional guidance for your specific environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to address the "You will run out of disk space soon" warning and improve your system's overall performance.",
