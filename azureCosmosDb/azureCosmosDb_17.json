2. If you have a large number of items in your database, consider implementing partitioning strategies such as partitioning by date range or by usage patterns. This can help distribute the data more evenly across partitions and reduce the likelihood of any one partition becoming overloaded.
3. Monitor the resource utilization of your Azure CosmosDB account regularly. By keeping an eye on things like throughput, latency, and storage capacity, you can identify potential issues before they become critical.
4. If necessary, scale up or down your Azure CosmosDB resources based on demand. This can help ensure that your database remains performant while also preventing it from becoming overwhelmed.
5. Keep your Azure CosmosDB SDK up-to-date. Regular updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes that can help optimize your database's performance and stability.
6. Lastly, if you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, you may want to contact Microsoft Support for further assistance. They can provide more specific guidance based on your particular situation and environment.",
