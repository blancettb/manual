 2. Adjust the number of concurrent actions allowed. If there are too many concurrent actions, some may be rejected. You can lower the limit to reduce the number of rejections.
 3. Investigate the cause of the rejected threads. It could be due to various reasons such as resource exhaustion or application issues. Once the root cause is identified, address it appropriately.
 4. Monitor the Elasticsearch node's performance over time. If the number of rejected threads continues to rise despite your efforts, consider scaling up the cluster or upgrading your hardware resources.

If you're still experiencing issues with Rejected actions after trying these steps, please provide more context about your environment and the specific error message you're encountering. I'll be happy to help further.",
