2. If the TCP send buffer is indeed over 80%, consider increasing the size of the send buffer for the DRBD data connection. This can be done by modifying the `/etc/drbd.conf` file on both nodes and adjusting the `send_buffer` value. The recommended value is typically between 64KB and 128KB.
3. After making the necessary changes, restart the DRBD service on both nodes for the changes to take effect.
4. Once the DRBD service has been restarted, monitor the network traffic again using tools like iotop or tcpdump to ensure that the TCP send buffer remains below 80%.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the DRBD Connection Congested issue and improve the overall performance of your DRBD setup.",
