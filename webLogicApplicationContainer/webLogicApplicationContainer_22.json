 2. Verify that the JDBC driver is properly installed and up-to-date.
 3. Inspect the WebLogic logs for any error messages related to the datasource.
 4. If the problem persists, consider checking the datasource's configuration in the WebLogic Admin Console.
 5. Lastly, restarting the affected WebLogic server may help resolve the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, further troubleshooting might be required, such as examining network traffic or checking for any third-party dependencies affecting the datasource.

For more information on troubleshooting WebLogic issues, refer to the Oracle documentation: <https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/weblogic/12.2.1.4/bipgk/index.html>
