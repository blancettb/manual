2. Verify that the application is started and running properly. You can check this by navigating to the "Servers" section in the WebLogic Administration Console and verifying that the application is listed as started.
3. If the application is not running, start it manually by clicking on the "Start" button in the WebLogic Administration Console.
4. Check if there are any missing dependencies or required components that might be causing the Health state issue. Ensure that all necessary libraries and modules are included in the project and have been deployed correctly.
5. If the problem persists, consider increasing the log level for the Health state events in the WebLogic Administration Console. This will provide more detailed information about the Health state and help you identify the root cause of the issue.
6. If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact Oracle Support for further assistance.
