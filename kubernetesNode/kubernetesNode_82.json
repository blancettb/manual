2. If there are any nodes with a status of "Unschedulable", address those first. You can do this by checking the logs of the affected nodes or by restarting the Kubernetes scheduler on that node.
3. Once the Unschedulable nodes have been addressed, check the status of your pods again using the command `kubectl get pods`.
4. If the Allocatable pod count is still too low, you may need to increase the number of allowed pods for your node. To do this, edit the `kubernetes.yml` file in your project's root directory and update the `node-selector` value for your node. The `node-selector` value specifies the minimum number of pods that should be scheduled onto the node.
5. After updating the `kubernetes.yml` file, re-run the `kubectl apply -f <file>` command to apply the changes.
6. Monitor the status of your nodes and pods after making these changes. If the Allocatable pod count remains high, you may need to further adjust the `node-selector` value or consider adding more nodes to your cluster.

If you're still experiencing issues, it might be helpful to consult the official Kubernetes documentation or seek assistance from the community.",
